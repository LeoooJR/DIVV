Why VCFDelta?
vcftoolz has not been maintained for the past two years. This package relies on PyVCF, whose last commit dates back over five years. VCFDelta is designed for optimal performance in terms of computational resource usage and processing time. It leverages the CyVCF2 library, which is actively maintained, providing superior VCF file parsing compared to PyVCF. Additionally, tasks are parallelized to enhance efficiency. Moreover, a dynamic report is generated, offering users an optimized and user-friendly visualization of the results.
