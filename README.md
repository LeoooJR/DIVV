## :pencil: About The Project <a name="about">

<p align="justify">
DIVV is a software tool designed for comparing two VCF files that have been generated from panel sequencing.<br>
It leverages the CyVCF2 library, which is actively maintained, providing superior VCF file parsing compared to PyVCF. Additionally, tasks are parallelized to enhance efficiency. Moreover, a dynamic report is generated, offering users an optimized and user-friendly visualization of the results.
